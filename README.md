## How does it work? 

The game is pretty simple and straight forward. You are playing against 
the computer where the computer choses Rock, Paper or Scissors at random. 
While this is happening the user has also the same options. The result will then be presented
and either one of the players will get a point for each time they win. You will also have the option
of playing multiple rounds against the Computer and also reset the game at any point!
